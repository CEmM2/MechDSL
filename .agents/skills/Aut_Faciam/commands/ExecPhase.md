# ExecPhase

Execute all tasks in a phase through quality gates, tracking gate history locally and updating GitHub issues at meaningful state transitions.

**Inputs:**
- `<phase_id>`: the current phase to execute (integer)
- `<plan_file>`: path to a markdown plan, spec, or RFC document
- `<tasks_folder>`: if provided, otherwise defaults to `dev/tasks/<plan file name>/`
- `<tracking_file>`: if provided, otherwise defaults to `dev/tracking/tasks-tracker_<plan file name>.md`

---

## Step 1 — Load Context

Read the `<plan_file>` in full. Extract:
- The purpose and goals of the current phase and how it feeds into subsequent phases
- Any explicit scope boundaries, non-goals, or architectural constraints
- Cross-phase dependencies that may affect implementation decisions in this phase

Find the context summary file (`Phase_<phase_id>_context_summary.md`) in `<tasks_folder>`.

If `<phase_id>` is greater than 1, search for a handoff file (`Handoff_Phase_<phase_id>.md`) in `<tasks_folder>` and read it in full.

Load `<tasks_folder>/github_issue_map.json` to have issue numbers available throughout execution.

Initialize (or load existing) `<tasks_folder>/gates/phase_<phase_id>_gates.md` for gate history tracking.

**Search existing gate files for patterns:** Before starting execution, scan all existing `gates/phase_*_gates.md` files for failure patterns. If previous phases encountered recurring issues (e.g., a common `physics_error` pattern), note these so implementers can be warned upfront.

---

## Step 2 — Task Analysis

Read `all-tasks.md` inside `<tasks_folder>`. For each task belonging to the current phase:
- Map blocking and blocked-by relationships
- Assess complexity (1–5 scale: 1 = trivial, 5 = highly complex)
- Assess risk (1–5 scale: 1 = low risk, 5 = high risk)

Create `Phase_<phase_id>_Tasks_analysis.md` inside `<tasks_folder>`:

```
| Task ID | Title | Complexity (1-5) | Risk (1-5) | Combined Score | Blocked By | Blocks |
|---------|-------|-----------------|------------|----------------|------------|--------|
```

Apply the **Model Assignment Rules** from SKILL.md Shared Architecture to determine which model each subagent uses.

---

## Step 3 — Branch Setup

```bash
git checkout -b <plan_name>_phase-<phase_id>
```

Never implement on `main` or `master` without explicit user consent.

---

## Step 4 — Execution Order

1. **Never execute a task whose blocker has not been marked complete and verified** (evidence of passing tests required — not the subagent's claim alone).
2. **Parallel first pass:** Identify all tasks where both complexity ≤ 3 AND risk ≤ 3 AND all blockers are satisfied. Dispatch these in parallel — one subagent per task. Each task's `gh issue edit` (label flip to in-progress) can run concurrently — these are independent calls.
3. **Sequential high-risk tasks:** Tasks where complexity OR risk > 3 are executed one at a time, each in its own commit.
4. Process remaining tasks in dependency order after the parallel batch completes and is verified.

---

## Step 5 — Implementation Dispatch

For each task, dispatch an implementer subagent using the template at `templates/task_instructions_template.md`. **Provide the full task text inline — do not make the subagent read files itself.**

**If the implementer subagent asks questions before starting:** Answer them fully and completely before allowing it to proceed.

**GitHub update (1 `gh` call):**

```bash
gh issue edit <task_issue> --remove-label "blocked" --add-label "in-progress"
```

**Gate history:** Initialize the task's entry in `gates/phase_<phase_id>_gates.md` with the start timestamp and branch name (see `templates/gate_entry.md` for format).

---

## Step 6 — Review Gates (mandatory, in this order)

After each implementer subagent reports completion, run gates A → B → C in sequence. **Do not skip or reorder them.**

**During all gate review loops: no `gh` calls.** All gate attempts are recorded in `gates/phase_<phase_id>_gates.md` only. Use the format from `templates/gate_entry.md`.

### Gate A — Spec Compliance Review

Dispatch a spec compliance reviewer subagent using the template at `templates/spec_compliance_template.md`. **Provide the FULL TASK JSON CONTENT inline.**

**If spec review finds issues:** Record the failure in the gates file (failure mode, what failed, why). The implementer fixes them, then spec review runs again. Record the resolution on the passing attempt. Repeat until pass. Do not proceed to Gate B until Gate A passes.

### Gate B — Domain Quality Review

Only dispatch after Gate A passes.

Review the task implementation for correctness and adherence to the requirements specs and design in `dev/design_docs/`. Provide:
- The task spec
- The implementer's report
- The BASE_SHA (commit before the task) and HEAD_SHA (current commit)

**If the reviewer raises issues:** Record in gates file, mark task as WIP in tracker, fix, re-run Gate A, then re-run Gate B. Repeat until approved.

### Gate C — Verification Before Completion

Before updating any tracking file or marking any task complete, run the full test command fresh and read the actual output. Apply the Iron Law:

```
1. IDENTIFY: What command proves this task passes?
2. RUN: Execute the FULL command (fresh, not cached)
3. READ: Full output — check exit code, count pass/fail
4. VERIFY: Does output confirm ≥ 95% pass on all task-relevant tests?
   - If NO: Record in gates file, return to implementation
   - If YES: Record exact evidence (e.g., "47/49 tests passed")
5. ONLY THEN: Update tracking file
```

**Do not use:** "should pass", "probably works", "looks correct", or any claim without fresh run evidence. No exceptions.

---

## Step 7 — Task Completion (after all three gates pass)

### Local updates:

Update `<tracking_file>`:
- Mark task as complete
- Fill ALL previously empty cells for the completed task
- In "Verified by": list every test file written or modified, including any from dry-run failure-route analysis
- Record exact test pass evidence from Gate C

Update the task's JSON file with:
- `"status": "done"`
- `"completion_date": "<today>"`
- `test_completion` with actual pass/fail counts from Gate C
- `review_score` and `review_breakdown` from Gate B (minor/medium/high/critical issue counts)
- `"review_status": "approved"`
- `"implementation_branch": "<current branch name>"`
- `completion_notes` with any notable implementation decisions or deviations

Record completion timestamp in `gates/phase_<phase_id>_gates.md`.

### GitHub updates (3-4 `gh` calls):

```bash
# 1. Labels + close (2 calls)
gh issue edit <task_issue> --remove-label "in-progress" --add-label "done,gate-a-pass,gate-b-pass"
gh issue close <task_issue>

# 2. Check off in phase issue (1 call)
# Fetch body, replace "- [ ] #<task_issue>" with "- [x] #<task_issue>", update
gh issue view <phase_issue> --json body -q .body > /tmp/phase_body.md
# (do the replacement)
gh issue edit <phase_issue> --body-file /tmp/phase_body.md

# 3. Unblock downstream (1 call per newly-unblocked task)
gh issue edit <downstream_task_issue> --remove-label "blocked"
```

---

## Step 8 — Repeat for All Phase Tasks

Return to Step 4 and process the next eligible task (respecting dependencies). Continue until all tasks in `<phase_id>` are complete with all three gates passing.

---

## Step 9 — Phase Handoff

When all tasks in the current phase are complete and verified, generate a handoff file in `<tasks_folder>` following the template at `templates/Handoff_template.md`. Name it `Handoff_Phase_<next_phase_id>.md`.

**If this is the final phase** (no next phase exists), still generate the handoff as a project completion summary, but skip the "edit next phase issue" step. Close the current phase issue and check it off in the plan overview. The plan overview issue itself stays open as a record — the user can close it manually when they consider the plan fully delivered.

### GitHub updates (3 `gh` calls, or 2 if final phase):

1. Edit the next phase's issue body to include the handoff (skip if this is the final phase):

```bash
gh issue view <next_phase_issue> --json body -q .body > /tmp/next_phase_body.md
# (replace the "Pending" placeholder with the full handoff inside a collapsible <details> block)
gh issue edit <next_phase_issue> --body-file /tmp/next_phase_body.md
```

2. Close the current phase issue:

```bash
gh issue close <current_phase_issue>
```

3. Check off the phase in the plan overview issue (same fetch-replace-update pattern):

```bash
gh issue view <plan_overview_issue> --json body -q .body > /tmp/overview_body.md
# (replace "- [ ] ... #<current_phase_issue>" with "- [x] ...")
gh issue edit <plan_overview_issue> --body-file /tmp/overview_body.md
```
