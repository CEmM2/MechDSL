## Phase <phase_id> Completion Summary

| Task ID | Title | Commit | Tests (pass/total) | Failing Tests |
|---------|-------|--------|--------------------|---------------|
|         |       |        |                    |               |

**Overall test status**: X/Y task-dedicated tests passing across the phase.

## Architecture and State After Phase <phase_id>

> What the codebase looks like NOW. The next agent must understand this before touching anything.

- **New files created**: (paths + one-line purpose each)
- **Modified files**: (paths + what changed)
- **New Taichi fields/kernels**: (names, shapes, dtypes, what they represent)
- **Data layout changes**: (anything that affects how other modules read/write state)
- **Interfaces added or changed**: (function signatures, class APIs, config keys)

## Assumptions Made During Phase <phase_id>

> Decisions taken that were not explicit in the spec. These may need revisiting.

| Assumption | Where it applies | Rationale | Risk if wrong |
|------------|-----------------|-----------|---------------|
|            |                 |           |               |

## Known Issues and Deferred Concerns

### Failing tests (quantified)
| Test name/file | Failure reason | Impact on Phase <phase_id+1> |
|----------------|---------------|------------------------------|
|                |               |                              |

### Known bugs or behavioral limitations
> Issues observed but intentionally out of scope for this phase.

### Test coverage gaps
> Behaviors that are untested or only partially tested. Flag anything where a gap could affect Phase <phase_id+1> correctness.

## Lessons Learned

### Process
> Parallelism conflicts, subagent coordination issues, review loop patterns, etc.

### Physics and numerics
> Constitutive model behavior, solver tolerance surprises, stability issues, convergence patterns, etc.

## What Phase <phase_id+1> Must Know Before Starting

> High-signal context that is NOT obvious from reading the plan or the task files.

- **Critical dependencies**: which Phase <phase_id> outputs Phase <phase_id+1> tasks directly consume
- **High-risk tasks in Phase <phase_id+1>**: flag the 1-2 tasks most likely to cause problems and why
- **Recommended starting point**: which task to tackle first and why
- **Anything that would have saved Phase <phase_id> significant time if known at the start**
